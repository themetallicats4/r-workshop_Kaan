## Inferential Analysis

1. Open `exercise03.qmd`
2. Load the merged dataset in R
3. Filter the dataset to a year of your choosing
4. Conduct and interpret the following tests for the dependent variable `gini_disp`:
    a. A t-test with the IV `democracy`
    b. An ANOVA with the IV `rotw`
    c. A Bonferroni test for 4b
5. Estimate the following OLS models with `gini_disp` as a dependent variable:
    a. Simple linear model with `edi` as a predictor
    b. Multiple linear model with `edi`, `gdp_pc` and `oil` as predictors
    c. A linear model with an interaction of `edi` and `vote_share_cat`
6. Interpret the effect of `edi` from 5c across the different levels of `vote_share_cat` by calculating the average marginal effects
7. Save the predicted average marginal effects from 6. as a `.csv` file
