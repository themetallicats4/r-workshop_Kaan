## Preparing Data

Prepare your data like this:

1. Load the V-Dem and SWIID data
2. Merge the data based on `year` and `country_name`/`country`
3. Create the following new variables:
	a. `democracy`: Binary indicator whether country is a democracy based on `edi`
	b. `inequality`: Categorical indicator whether country has **high**, **medium** or **low** inequality based on `gini_disp`
4. Filter the dataset to only include observations before the year 2020
5. Save the new version of your data locally as a `.csv` file

You can either do all of these tasks in the following chunk, or create your own structure with own chunks.

```{r}
