```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
    print("Hello")
}
```

Another use case of for loops is iterating through a data structure’s elements. The syntax for this also requires a loop variable, the keyword in, and the data structure’s name.


```{r}
my_vector <- c("this", "is", "being", "read", "by", "a", "for", "loop")

for(word in my_vector){
    print(word)
}
```
