```{r message=FALSE}
number_of_heads <- 0
heads_goal <- 2
coin <- c("heads", "tails")

while(number_of_heads < heads_goal){
    #flip the coin (random)
    result <- sample(coin, 1)
    print(result)
    if(result == "heads") {
        number_of_heads <- number_of_heads + 1
    }
}
```

Apparently, sample() function randomly outputs among given options.
