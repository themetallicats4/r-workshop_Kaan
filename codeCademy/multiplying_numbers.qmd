Write a for loop to multiply all the numbers of a vector numbers together and keep the product in a variable called product, which weâ€™ve set to 1 at the beginning. The product, which will be printed, should equal 81 at the end.

```{r}
numbers <- c(1.5, 3, 2, 4, 3, 0.25, 3)
product <- 1

########

for(num in numbers){
    product = product * num
}

print(product)



```
