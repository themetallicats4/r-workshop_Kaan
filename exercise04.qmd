1. Open `exercise04.qmd`

5. Load the data on the mean `gini_disp` per `year` by `democracy` status saved from exercise 2 (task 5c)
6. Create a line chart with `geom_line` using this data
    a. The year should be on the x axis
    b. The Gini value should be on the y axis
    c. The groups should have separate lines using the `colour` property
